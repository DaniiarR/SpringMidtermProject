# SpringMidtermProject

Heroku link:    https://daniiarr-midterm-project.herokuapp.com/
The project has full support for adding new customers.
Spring Security: not implemented
Classes are structured under corresponding packages (model, dao, controller, service, repository).
Views are generated using Thymeleaf + Bootstrap.

Also, I've added REST endpoint for deleting and updating customers.

DELETE: https://daniiarr-midterm-project.herokuapp.com/customers/{customerId}

PUT: https://daniiarr-midterm-project.herokuapp.com/customers/customer  (you have to send JSON)

The classy design is obtained using Bootstrap.

Everything is implemented by myself.
